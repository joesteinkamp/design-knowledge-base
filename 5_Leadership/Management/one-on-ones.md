   2. What can I do this upcoming week to help you?

* Start with every week then change cadence, if necessary
* Add agenda to 1-on-1 invite
* Don't be afraid to schedule the meetings longer or short based on agenda
* Always include an agenda
* Build in ways to gather feedback about myself
* Be proactive and help coach them rather then relying solely on them to raise issues
* Once a month focus on behavioral feedback and career goals (long-term)
