# Reports Peer One-on-Ones

A short 30-minute check-in with a peer of one of your reports to get a better gauge on how things are going. *Kind of like 360 reviews but lighter weight and more frequent.*

**Frequency:** *Consider having these check-ins at least once a quarter.*

## Pre-Call Survey
Questions to get a basic understanding on how a person can improve. You do it before to cover the basics then go deeper on things in the one-on-one conversation.

- What should they start doing?
- What should they continue doing?
- What should they stop doing?

## Potential Agenda

You can comment on the pre-call survey responses but ideally you use the call to go deeper on more specific topics.

**Relationship Building**
It's very important to have a repore with the person.
- How are you?
- How can I help?
- etc...

### Competencies Check

Pick one question from each category. While all great questions to ask, attempt to ask them over regular check-ins rather than getting all in a single moment.

General Productivity
- Does they effectively solve problems? Do they produce high-quality work (in the context of time constraints)?
- Are their work methods and approach to accomplishing their job effective, efficient, and continuously improving?
- Do they appear to be motivated by their work?


Communication
- Do you trust them? *Do you trust their reasoning? Do you trust they'll support your decisions?*
- Do they communicate information, ideas, and concepts clearly?
- When they work with co-workers, what inter-personal skills do they demonstrate?

Humility
- How well do they bring the entire squad into the design process?
- Do they actively seek feedback? Do they respond positively to feedback? 
- Are they eager to learn and committed to ongoing development?
- **Eng Specific:** Do you feel like you're able to shape the designs before engineering?

Evangelism
- How well do they explain their design decisions?
- How well do they explain what's important to the user experience?
- Do they advocate for design system improvements? 
- **Design Specific:** Do they take the time to mentor and coach you?


Business Fluency
- How are they involved in the problem definition?

Technical Fluency
- How well do they break down their work?
- How well do they anticipate engineering's concerns and cares?


## Appendix

Different approaches with different roles:

**PM:** Focus more on definition, trust

**Engineer:** Focus more on collaboration, inclusion, humble, and iterative.

**Designer:** Focus more on mentorship, productivity
