# Reports Peer One-on-Ones

A short 30-minute check-in with a peer of one of your reports to get a better gauge on how things are going. *Kind of like 360 reviews but lighter weight and more frequent.*

**Frequency:** *Consider having these check-ins at least once a quarter.*


## Potential Agenda

**Relationship Building**
It's very important to have a repore with the person.
- How are you?
- How can I help?
- etc...

### Competencies Check

Pick one question from each category. While all great questions to ask, attempt to ask them over regular check-ins rather than getting all in a single moment.

General Productivity
- Are their work methods and approach to accomplishing their job effective, efficient, and continuously improving?
- Do they appear to be motivated by their work?
- Does the employee effectively solve problems? Do they produce high-quality work (in the context of time constraints)?


Communication
- Do you have trust them?
- Do they communicate information, ideas, and concepts clearly?
- When they work with co-workers, what inter-personal skills do they demonstrate?

Humility
- How well do they bring the entire squad into the design process?
- Do they actively seek and respond positively to feedback? 
- Are they eager to learn and committed to ongoing development?
- **Eng Specific:** Do you feel like you're able to shape the designs before engineering?

Evangelism
- How well do they explain their design decisions?
- How well do they explain what's important to the user experience?
- Do they advocate for design system improvements? 
- **Design Specific:** Do they take the time to mentor and coach you?


Business Fluency
- How are they involved in the problem definition?

Technical Fluency
- How well do they break down their work?
- How well do they anticipate engineering's concerns and cares?


### Post-Call Survey
- What should they start doing?
- What should they continue doing?
- What should they stop doing?
