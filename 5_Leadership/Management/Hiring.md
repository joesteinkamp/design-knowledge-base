#### Portfolio Review
*45 minute presentation, 15 minute Q&A*
The goal is to understand how they have worked, their hard skills, and their ability to present.

**Product Designer: What to Look for**
1. User First: Do they describe who the user is first and ground you in the problem? Do they speak about how the user has guided specific decision throughout the process (design principles, etc…)? 
2. Craftsmanship: Did the designer sweat over all the details, both big and small, of the end-to-end product? Is there a sense that the final product is well-made? We’re not looking for something that’s just functional. We want products that leave people feeling like the folks who built this cared about them and their individual experiences. 
3. Interaction design: Can you design intuitive end-to-end user flows? Do you consider edge cases appropriately? How easy is it to get from point A to point B in an app you designed? Is the design thoughtful and clear for how this product works? Does the designer have a good grasp of common patterns and interactions?
4. Product thinking: What problems are you trying to solve? Who are you designing for? What features should be included in your product, and why? Did they speak to and understand the business outcomes?
5. Collaborative Process: Did they demonstrate involving others in their design process? Workshops? Reviews? Stakeholder Interviews?
6. Storytelling: Did they break down the problem so that it was easy to understand?

**Product Designer: Questions to Ask**
1. What were the problems you were trying to solve?
2. Who did you partner with?
3. What kind of research did you perform, if any?
4. Why did you choose that design solution over this one?
5. What were the tradeoffs?
6. What challenges did you face in designing X?
7. If you had more time to work on it, what would you change?
8. If you got stuck on a certain design problem, how did you overcome it?
9. Visual design: How polished are your designs? Do they feel well-crafted and refined? Are they aesthetically pleasing?
10. Interaction design: Can you design intuitive end-to-end user flows? Do you consider edge cases appropriately? How easy is it to get from point A to point B in an app you designed?
11. Product thinking: What problems are you trying to solve? Who are you designing for? What features should be included in your product, and why?
12. Usability: “Is it easy to use? Is the design thoughtful and clear for how this product works? Does the designer have a good grasp of common patterns and interactions?”
13. Craftsmanship: “Did the designer sweat over all the details, both big and small, of the end-to-end product? Is there a sense that the final product is well-made? We’re not looking for something that’s just functional. We want products that leave people feeling like the folks who built this cared about them and their individual experiences. That aspect of high quality and craft is extremely important to us.
14. Think of a long-term project in your portfolio. “If you had two more months to work on it, what would you have done differently? What would have you added or continued to refine?” Thoughtful candidates are the ones who have been so attached to a project that they’ve thought many many times about how they could have made it better. “Occasionally you’ll get people who’ll say what they ended up with was perfect and they’d change nothing, or who suggest very minor cosmetic changes, which doesn’t come across as super thoughtful.”
15. What was the timing for the project?
16. What was their responsibilities? What did they actually produce that they're showing?
17. How do they go about convincing stakeholders of their design decisions, especially when being challenged?
18. Process within a project or the ideal process?
19. What was the assignment or ask? How did they interpret it? 
20. Why did they choose the approach they went with versus other options? What alternatives did they consider? 
21. What problems or challenges did they encounter along the way? How did they overcome them? 
22. Who did they ask questions to when they had them? What kind of questions did they have? What lessons did they learn from it?
