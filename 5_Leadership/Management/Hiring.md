## Getting Started

### Hiring Principles
1. Hire people closer to your users
2. Move quickly - no more than a few days between contact. We're in an aggressive market where the top talent is highly sought after.

**Small Teams**
1. Small team need generalist - can do at least 2 things well
2. Need to build ritual for team (process)
3. How does the organization engage with the new team
4. High-level of ambiguity - self-govern and pro-active problem solvers
