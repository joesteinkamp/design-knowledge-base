#### Background Deep-Dive
The goal is to go through past experience to determine ability and alignment of our position (scorecard).

It’s a chronological walk-through of a person’s career. You begin by asking about the highs and lows of a person’s educational experience to gain insight into his or her background. Then you ask five simple questions, for each job in the past fifteen years, beginning with the earliest and working your way forward to the present day.

1. What were you hired to do? How was your success measured? 
*Look for: What were their mission and key outcomes? What competencies might have mattered?*
2. What accomplishments are you most proud of?
*Look for: Outcomes that match mission above.*
3. What were some low points during the job? What went really wrong? What was your biggest mistake? What would you have done differently? What part of the job did you not like? In what ways were your peers stronger than you?
*Look for: Look for understanding of areas for growth, identify environments not meant for them.*
4. What would your boss say were your strengths and areas for improvement?
*Use to compare against during reference checks.*
5. Why did you leave? How did your boss react?
*Look for: Stories of progressing career (hitting ceilings, trying new domains), philosophical differences between bosses, getting fired, their boss was disappointed about the news*

#### Portfolio Review
*45 minute presentation, 15 minute Q&A*
The goal is to understand how they have worked, their hard skills, and their ability to present.

**Product Designer: What to Look for**
1. User First: Do they describe who the user is first and ground you in the problem? Do they speak about how the user has guided specific decision throughout the process (design principles, etc…)? 
2. Craftsmanship: Did the designer sweat over all the details, both big and small, of the end-to-end product? Is there a sense that the final product is well-made? We’re not looking for something that’s just functional. We want products that leave people feeling like the folks who built this cared about them and their individual experiences. 
3. Interaction design: Can you design intuitive end-to-end user flows? Do you consider edge cases appropriately? How easy is it to get from point A to point B in an app you designed? Is the design thoughtful and clear for how this product works? Does the designer have a good grasp of common patterns and interactions?
4. Product thinking: What problems are you trying to solve? Who are you designing for? What features should be included in your product, and why? Did they speak to and understand the business outcomes?
5. Collaborative Process: Did they demonstrate involving others in their design process? Workshops? Reviews? Stakeholder Interviews?
6. Storytelling: Did they break down the problem so that it was easy to understand?

**Activities**

2. Discuss [5 minutes]
3. Crazy 8s [8 minutes]
4. Discuss 2 ideas [5 minutes]
5. Storyboard [10 minutes]
6. Discuss 

**Alternative Take Home Design Assignment**
Only 30% of scheduled Internet installation appointments start on time with afternoon times getting as much as 2 hours delayed leading to frustrated personnel (longer work days) and customers (time expectations not met). Variance in installation times is impacted by many factors but the number one is house type - small family home versus low rise versus high rise.

How would you better schedule appointments for installers so they’re more likely to stay on schedule?
Keep your ideas constrained to current technology abilities, preferably on mobile.

Please be prepared to explain your recommendation and how you came to it when we do our video interview. We will spend 30-60 minutes discussing it at the end of the interview. 
	
Lastly, please time-box your work to no longer than 3 hours and make any assumptions you need to.

  **Alternative**
  Reimagine and redesign an existing digital product of your choice that showcases your skills and abilities to solve a complex problem as a designer.


##### Critique
Goal: Understand their attention to detail
Give your candidate the chance to assess what your team has done so far — and to articulate what they’d keep, what they’d change, and why.

- What would they be excited about changing? 
- How do they think it could be improved? 
- How would they work with you to figure out the best design and solution?
