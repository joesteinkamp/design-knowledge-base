#### Portfolio Review
*45 minute presentation, 15 minute Q&A*
The goal is to understand how they have worked, their hard skills, and their ability to present.

#### Participants
**Minimum:** Hiring manager and engineer
**Ideal:** Hiring manager, engineer, designer, and PM

**Product Designer: What to Look for**
1. User First: Do they describe who the user is first and ground you in the problem? Do they speak about how the user has guided specific decision throughout the process (design principles, etc…)? 
2. Craftsmanship: Did the designer sweat over all the details, both big and small, of the end-to-end product? Is there a sense that the final product is well-made? We’re not looking for something that’s just functional. We want products that leave people feeling like the folks who built this cared about them and their individual experiences. 
3. Interaction design: Can you design intuitive end-to-end user flows? Do you consider edge cases appropriately? How easy is it to get from point A to point B in an app you designed? Is the design thoughtful and clear for how this product works? Does the designer have a good grasp of common patterns and interactions?
4. Product thinking: What problems are you trying to solve? Who are you designing for? What features should be included in your product, and why? Did they speak to and understand the business outcomes?
5. Collaborative Process: Did they demonstrate involving others in their design process? Workshops? Reviews? Stakeholder Interviews?
6. Storytelling: Did they break down the problem so that it was easy to understand?

6. Discuss 

**Alternative Take Home Design Assignment**
Only 30% of scheduled Internet installation appointments start on time with afternoon times getting as much as 2 hours delayed leading to frustrated personnel (longer work days) and customers (time expectations not met). Variance in installation times is impacted by many factors but the number one is house type - small family home versus low rise versus high rise.

How would you better schedule appointments for installers so they’re more likely to stay on schedule?
Keep your ideas constrained to current technology abilities, preferably on mobile.

Please be prepared to explain your recommendation and how you came to it when we do our video interview. We will spend 30-60 minutes discussing it at the end of the interview. 
	
Lastly, please time-box your work to no longer than 3 hours and make any assumptions you need to.

  **Alternative**
  Reimagine and redesign an existing digital product of your choice that showcases your skills and abilities to solve a complex problem as a designer.
