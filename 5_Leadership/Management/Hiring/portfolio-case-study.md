# Portfolio Case Study
*1 hr portfolio review*

A review of a designer's work to determine if the candidate has the execution capabilities necessary to be successful and how they work with others. The presentation should cover their end-to-end design process to understand how they like to work, the output quality, and hopefully the impact and outcomes their work achieved.

Goal is to have them focus on the project they're most proud of and explain why.
