### Email Template
```
Hi {Name},

We're excited to learn more about your design experience. We'd like to see your most recent UI work that represents your visual and interaction design skills. We do not want a presentation. In fact, we would rather see only a single screen or short flow that was the final output for the project, within your design tool is preferred.

At {Company Name}, we're responsible for the entire end-to-end design process and this call is focused on final output. We understand that there is a lot of depth to your process beyond the final out and we fully intend to go through that in our following hour and a half step.

We expect the project review to be around 10-15 minutes and will be with the {Hiring Manager} and possibly another designer. Then we'll give the remaining time to you for questions.

Tips
- Show work that best represents UI skills through a more complex screen or flow (ex. desktop or mobile flow with variety of screen)
- Focus 1 minute overview on the problems and jobs to be done you're trying to solve and less on process

Let us know if you have any questions.
```

We'll spend the next step going into much more detail about your process.

Before we dive in and have you screen share, Please give a me a quick intro to the project. *Hope to hear about the user problem, business opportunity, and what success looks like.*
