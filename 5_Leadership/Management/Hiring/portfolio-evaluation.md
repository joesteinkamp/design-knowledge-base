*Disclaimer 1*
There are many intangibles that can be signals for a great candidates. This is a guide and not a decision framework.

*Disclaimer 2*
The skills you're looking for can heavily influence how you want to assess. For example, sometimes you're looking for a visually strong candidate so you're more willing to look past UX defencies, such as detailed process with research.
