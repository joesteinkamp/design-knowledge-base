### Next Steps
If the candidate has an excellent resume, portfolio evaluation, and phone screen, move them straight to the background interview to keep committment level a bit lower and have more time to sell.
**[Go to Background Interview](background-interview.md)**

If the candidate is interesting but there is still uncertainty in some areas, proceed with the portfolio presentation to get additional depth of their capabilities.
**[Go to Portfolio Presentation](portfolio-presentation.md)**

Otherwise, pass on the candidate and email them thanking them for their time.
