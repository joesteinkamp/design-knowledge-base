# Product Critique

Goal: Understand their attention to detail
Give your candidate the chance to assess what your team has done so far — and to articulate what they’d keep, what they’d change, and why.

- What would they be excited about changing? 
- How do they think it could be improved? 
- How would they work with you to figure out the best design and solution? 

**Tips**

- Provide context to the user while you present
- Critique it yourself as you present to make it more comfortable
