Hi {Name},

We're excited to learn more about your design experience. Here are the details of the portfolio presentation. The portfolio presentation is a chance for us to get to know your process and also see some of your design accomplishments that your most proud of.

	• The presentation will be 45 minutes, and you will be able to present a specific project of your choice to talk through. There will be questions throughout the 45 minutes, so aim for 20-30 minutes of individually presenting.
	• There will be about 3-4 people present. The group will be comprised of myself, a product manager, and a product designer.
	• Afterward, there will be 15 minutes to ask questions to the group then you and I will continue for the rest of the time.

Tips
	• An ideal project is one that best illustrates your design capabilities. Ideally, we’d like to see how your experience is relevant to the challenges you would face at our company. 
	• No need to go over your work history in this presentation, as people will already be familiar with your resume.
	• If you were working as part of a team, clearly identify your contributions to the process and the final product.
	• Avoid speaking in vague, general terms. Use specific examples to walk us through your design journey from the beginning to the end.

Don't hesitate to ask any questions you may have. We're excited to speak with you.
