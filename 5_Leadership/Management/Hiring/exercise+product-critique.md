Hi {Name},

Thank you so much for all of your time so far, and for sharing such a comprehensive presentation to the team. The team really enjoyed learning more about your design process and contributions, and all agreed that they would love to invite you to the final step in our interview process before references.

In this final round, you will get a chance to see our product in detail and work through a collaborative exercise to improve it. The meeting will be with {hiring manager} along with 1-2 designers, and a {product manager / leader}. The goal is to really understand how you think through new problems and how we can collaborate together. The only preparation would be to bring some from a sketching material (pen & paper, iPad, etc...) so you can upload some ideas into a Figma file that we'll share with you.

We'd like to schedule about 90 minutes for this meeting. Please provide your upcoming availability.
