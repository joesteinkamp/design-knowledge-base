### Email Template
```
Hi {Name},

Thank you so much for all of your time so far, and for sharing such a comprehensive presentation to the team. The team really enjoyed learning more about your design process and contributions, and all agreed that they would love to invite you to the final step in our interview process before references.

In this final round, you will get a chance to see our product in detail and work through a collaborative exercise to improve it. The meeting will be with {hiring manager} along with 1-2 designers, and a {product manager / leader}. The exercise portion will take about an hour. 

You'll be expected to lead us through how you'd approach thinking strategically on where to take the feature and define a directional sketch of where it could go. The group is there to collaborate with but we'll be following your lead. We're specifically looking to understand how you think through new problems and how we collaborate together. We will not be grading the solution. The only preparation would be to bring some from a sketching material (pen & paper, iPad, etc...) so you can upload some ideas into a Figma file that we'll share with you.

We'd like to schedule about 90 minutes for this meeting. Please provide your upcoming availability.
```
