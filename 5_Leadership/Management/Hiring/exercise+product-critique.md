#### Design Exercise Invite
```
Hi {Candidate Name},

We really enjoyed learning more about your design process and the team was very impressed. We’re excited to invite you to our final round interview, which is an exercise to improve part of our product. 

The exercise will be done completely in real-time and attempt to recreate a whiteboard experience as much as possible. It will be a mixture of individual effort and group collaboration to avoid homework - you’ll lead the collaboration but we encourage you to leverage us as much as possible. It will include the hiring manager along with 1-2 designers, and {PM / Product Leader}. Lastly, we’ll be specifically looking to understand how you think through new problems and how we collaborate together - we will not be grading the solution. 

We'll provide the focus area for the exercise details one day in advance to limit the desire to do homework. We’ll also provide access to the product ahead of time so you can get to know our product a little better.

When is a good time for you for the hour and a half for the design exercise {next week}?

Looking forward to hearing from you,

{Signature}

#### Day Before Reminder & Additional Info
```
Hi {Candidate Name},

We’re excited to have you join us tomorrow to run through our design exercise together. The interview will be a digital whiteboard exercise where you’ll lead us through your approach to solving our design brief within the hour. The last 30 minutes will be for questions.

To prepare for the exercise, we’ve created a Figma file for us to work through. The file includes screenshots of the primary flow of our client users and the design brief. The focus of the brief is to reimagine our Homepage to be a more engaging destination. Please take 5-10 minutes to review the screenshots as a reference to acclimate yourself to our product and review the full details in the brief. **The brief includes important details you don’t want to miss, including an outline of the schedule.**

In addition to the screenshots, we’ve created a staging login for you to check out our product on our on time. There are no expectations that you considerable time in here and it’s more of a reference for you to understand where our maturity is at and inspire questions.

Let me know if you have any questions.
