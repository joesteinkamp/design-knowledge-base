# Portfolio Presentation & Critique
*1 hr portfolio review +  30 minutes Q&A*

A review of a designer's work to determine if the candidate has the execution capabilities necessary to be successful and how they work with others. The presentation should cover their end-to-end design process to understand how they like to work, the output quality, and hopefully the impact and outcomes their work achieved.

Goal is to have them focus on the project they're most proud of and explain why.

What’s the project you worked on that you’re most proud of?

Hi {Name},
We're excited to learn more about your design experience. Here are the details of the portfolio presentation. The portfolio presentation is a chance for us to get to know your process, understand how you make decisions, and also see some of your design accomplishments that you're most proud of.

- The presentation and conversation will be 45 to 60 minutes, and you will be able to present one specific project of your choice to talk through. There will be many questions throughout, so aim for 20 minutes presenting if there was no discussion.
- There will be about 3-4 people present. The group will consist of myself, 1-2 product designers, and potentially our Head of Product.
- Afterward, there will be 30 minutes to ask questions to the group.
- Lastly, we intend to ask many questions to make the discussion more like an informal design review so it is preferable if you can share some or all of what you'll be sharing ahead of time to help us prepare.

Tips
- An ideal project is one that best illustrates your design capabilities. Ideally, we'd like to see how your experience is relevant to the challenges you would face at our company. 
- No need to go over your work history in this presentation, as people will already be familiar with your resume.
- If you were working as part of a team, clearly identify your contributions to the process and the final product.
- Avoid speaking in vague, general terms. Use specific examples to walk us through your design journey from the beginning to the end.
Don't hesitate to ask any questions you may have. We're excited to speak with you.
