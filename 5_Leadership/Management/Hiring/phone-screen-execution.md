Hi {Name},

We're excited to learn more about your design experience. We'd like to see your most recent work to get a quick snapshot of your work and your design decisions. We do not expect a presentation. In fact, we would rather see only a single screen or short flow that was the final output for the project, within your design tool is preferred.

We expect the project review to be around 10-15 minutes. Afterward, there will be a couple more questions. Then we'll give the remaining time for questions.

At {Company Name}, we're responsible for the entire end-to-end design process and this call is focused on final output. We understand that there is a lot of depth to your process beyond the final out and we fully intend to go through that in our following step.

Let us know if you have any questions.

We'll spend the next step going into much more detail about your process.
