#### Design Process Exercise
A conversational and informal session, with open/out loud brainstorming  The goal is to create an environment in which a design candidate can demonstrate his or her approach to user-driven discovery and design, research standards and the scientific method.

1. Provide a scenario that contains a problem and a high-level hypothesis to solving this problem.
2. Give them a few minutes to read the scenario.
3. Time for questions.
4. "With the solution hypothesis at the forefront of your mind, using the rest of the information as background, can you explain:"
   1. Without actually creating prototypes, explain what steps would you take to begin discovery:
   2. With whom would you conduct this discovery?
   3. For what would you be measuring?
   4. What are the outcomes of this round of discovery? How would you define success?
   6. What is the next round of discovery? How do you build on round one?  Describe round two.






#### Creativity Exercise

I can’t take credit for this one. I got the idea from Stephen Gates in his podcast The Crazy One and have found it to be extremely successful. I made one set of cards that has common everyday products (ladders, pencils, road cones, etc) and another set that has famous brands everyone would know (Google, Apple, Uber, IBM, Netflix, GE, etc). During an in-person interview, the candidate chooses one card from each pile and then has to pitch me why Google would make a sewing machine. I play the part of the brand’s executive team and the candidate is pitching a new product. They have 1 minute to think and then 5 minutes to pitch their idea.

The interesting thing is to see how their creativity starts to take over towards the end of the time (or not). This is a great judge of not only their creativity, but also their selling skills and their ability to think on their feet. Sometimes if someone gets a particular hard combination or if I’m on the fence following the first attempt, I’ll ask them to do it again. It might be a little nerve-racking for them, but it’s helped me hire incredibly creative designers with the ability to sell their designs.
