# Brand & Marketing Critique

*15 minutes*

By showing our brand, marketing materials, and product to the candidate, you can gauge how they think about design and approach learning by the questions they ask. The method is equal parts evaluation and a selling tool. Great designers are naturally curious and particular want to know where the experience is currently at to understand where they can provide value.

Also, pull up personality sliders, brand values, and competitive landscape to discuss similarities and differences.
