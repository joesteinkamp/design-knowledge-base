# OLD Strategy Design Workshop

The strategy workshop purpose is to have the team together to start the conversation on how the team could fulfill the opportunity by tackling the most critical problem with the most promising hypotheses. The exercise is about prioritization and focus rather than solutioning.

### When to Use

1. To generate hypotheses to solve defined problems
2. Solution space has very little constraint in the moment.
3. To determine which aspect of a problem space is the largest opportunity.

### Workshop Details

| Attendees | Ideal Size | Suggested Time |

### Agenda

#### Review UX Artifacts and Opportunity Statement \(15 minutes\)

Before the session, create empathy maps required to ground the workshop around the user's perspective. Review who the users are and what's important to them.

#### User Problems Generation \(5 minutes\)

On Post-Its, instruct everyone to capture all the problems they think the user faces in their journey or moment.

Think about the following:

* What are all the jobs-to-be-done?
* What is the problem that this product is going to solve?
* What is the motivation behind what the user wants?

Instructions

1. Each team member takes a turn reading all their HMW sticky notes/opportunities they’ve come up with.
2. As they verbally describe their individual problems notes, they place the corresponding sticky on the board.
3. Give each person around 3 minutes to finish so they’re encouraged to be short and sweet.
4. Team members can write down more problem notes if they get inspired by what others are sharing.
5. Wait until the third person has finished presenting before you start grouping the problem notes into categories. \(Tip: Don’t wait until everyone has finished sharing to do this. You’ll have a big, unwieldy task on your hands.\)
6. Don’t worry if it takes a bit for solid categories to form. It’s fine to adjust them as the sharing continues. And, if the first set of categories you make aren’t useful, you can always start over.
7. When everyone is done reading their problem notes, take a picture of all the notes.

#### Vote on Most Critical Problem Statements \(10 minutes\)

1. Each team member gets 3 votes, represented by dots that they will add to the sticky notes they like.
2. People are allowed to vote on their own sticky notes.
3. It’s also okay to put more than one dot on a note.
4. People should vote on the sticky notes and not the categories.
5. The team will pay more attention to the sticky notes with multiple dots.
6. You’re not trying to narrow down to just one direction or category. Instead, you’re highlighting areas of emphasis.

#### How Might We \[Define the Problem\] \(10 minutes\)

The HMW method allows your team to take the insights and pain points they heard and reframe them as questions. It also prevents people from narrowing in on solutions too early.

> "How might we solve \[Opportunity/Problem\]?"

#### HMW: Facilitated HMW Affinity Diagram \(3 minutes per person\)

Like with the problem statements before, place all the Post-its on a whiteboard and cluster similar statements. Write a summarized statement above each cluster.

1. Each team member takes a turn reading all their HMW sticky notes/opportunities they’ve come up with.
2. As they verbally describe their individual HMW notes, they place the corresponding sticky on the board.
3. Give each person around 3 minutes to finish so they’re encouraged to be short and sweet.
4. Team members can write down more HMW notes if they get inspired by what others are sharing.
5. Wait until the third person has finished presenting before you start grouping the HMW notes into categories. \(Tip: Don’t wait until everyone has finished sharing to do this. You’ll have a big, unwieldy task on your hands.\)
6. Don’t worry if it takes a bit for solid categories to form. It’s fine to adjust them as the HMW sharing session continues. And, if the first set of categories you make aren’t useful, you can always start over.

#### HMW Voting \(10 minutes\)

1. Each team member gets 3 votes, represented by dots that they will add to the sticky notes they like.
2. People are allowed to vote on their own sticky notes.
3. It’s also okay to put more than one dot on a note.
4. People should vote on the sticky notes and not the categories.
5. The team will pay more attention to the sticky notes with multiple dots.
6. You’re not trying to narrow down to just one direction or category. Instead, you’re highlighting areas of emphasis.
7. When everyone is done reading their HMW notes, take a picture of all the notes.
