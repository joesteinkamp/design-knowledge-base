### When to Use

1. When behavior happens over time and cannot be adequately seen within a couple hours in a contextual inquiry or ethnographic study.
2. To understand the context of the user's goals, needs, and potentially when they use your product.
3. To understand when the users needs are triggered and what triggers them.
4. To understand the impact of your product on the user's situation.

### Steps

1. Determine the activities you'd the participants to track and when \(either in the moment of the activity or specific times of day\).
2. Determine how long you'd like them to track. Consider the variability of the activity - more variability equals more time.
3. Create questions that you'd like your participants to answer every time they log their activity.
4. Give the participants instructions. Ask the participants to reflect on their feelings during the activity.
5. Begin the study.
6. Check in with the participants halfway through.
7. Collect the diaries.
