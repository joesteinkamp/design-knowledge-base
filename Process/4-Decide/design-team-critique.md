# Design Team Critique

A review of a proposed design or multiple designs with the design team. The goals are to provide transparency to other designers and to gather feedback to allow the lead designer to iterate and tweak the proposals.

### When to Use

1. Weekly to be transparent and support a collaborative design team
2. Use when the designs propose a new pattern.
3. Use to look for opportunities to connect related experiences.

### Critique Details

| Attendees | Ideal Size | Suggested Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Entire Design Team | 5 to 7 people | 15 to 30 minutes |

### Steps: Preparation

1. Schedule a recurring weekly design critique meeting
2. Facilitator role to schedule agenda
3. Facilitator requests presenters
4. Schedule 15-30 minute critiques \(longer at first to get comfortable\)
5. Update meeting with appropriate time and agenda

### Steps: Critique

1. The designer will present the problem and the user's story, including the project scope.
   1. Problem format:
      1. I am showing \[early/mid/late\] work
      2. Around \[the problem, include who the user is\]
      3. Because \[why it’s a problem\].
      4. We’ll have success if we see \[what do we want the user to do or understand\] 
      5. and am looking for feedback on \[what it looks like \(visuals & content\) / how it works \(interactions & IA\) / Direction\].
2. Make sure everyone understands the problem. Do not proceed to the designs until everyone agrees on the problem.
   1. _“Does this sound like a valid problem, is the problem statement confusing, is there anything that may have been overlooked? \[If early\] Do we agree that this is the problem that we should be solving? Is this one of the most important problems we should be solving right now?”_
3. Audience ask any clarification questions, if necessary.
4. Designer should proceed to present their work, preferably multiple approaches \(to self critique\).
5. Audience asks questions and likes only, thinking from the user's point of view. 
   1. _"What did I enjoy about this design and why? What concerns me about this design and why? What does this design remind me of and why?"_
6. Check against the company's design principles. 
7. Facilitator should take notes throughout to share at the end.
8. Facilitator at the end should ask, _"What are the next key steps you’ll take to move the work forward?”_

### Tips

1. Laptops stay closed \(except for presenter and facilitator\). Audience should focus on listening and asking questions.
2. Designers should always try to bring multiple approaches, especially during early work, so you can critique yourself by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach
3. Not everyone needs to say something. **We need to figure out how to agree with someone without reiterating.**
4. **Do not provide suggestions on how to fix issues**. Put the power into the designers hands. If the designer feels like they have no idea where to begin ask "What do you suggest?". If the designer leaves the critique and becomes stuck, the should pull together the team to get collaboratively try to solve the problem.

>
> * Criticism finds fault/Critique looks at structure
> * Criticism looks for what's lacking/Critique finds what's working
> * Criticism condemns what it doesn't understand/Critique asks for clarification
> * Criticism is spoken with a cruel wit and sarcastic tongue/Critique's voice is kind, honest, and objective
> * Criticism is negative/Critique is positive \(even about what isn't working\)
> * Criticism is vague and general/Critique is concrete and specific
> * Criticism has no sense of humor/Critique insists on laughter, too
> * Criticism looks for flaws in the writer as well as the writing/Critique addresses only what is on the page

### Standard Questions to Ask:

**Quality Questions**

1. Would we stand up in a room of our peers and claim this work as our own? Would we be proud to say that we worked on this? _If the answer is no, we go back and figure out why not._
2. Would we write an article about something noteworthy here?

**Outcome Questions**

1. What would success look like for the design? 
2. What do you expect to change for the user? 
3. What behavior to you want to drive?
4. How much will this change the lives of the user?

**Visual Design Questions**

1. Does it adhere to the 5 styles rule? _Count all colors and type styles on the screen, if more than 5 try to reduce. _
2. Is it following our grid system?
