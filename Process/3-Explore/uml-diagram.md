# Site Map

A visual representation of all the pages available within an app or site, the hierarchy of content, and the relationships the pages have to each other.

### When to Use

1. To determine the pages that will be required within further design exploration, such as wireframes.
2. To recommend a new architecture to the content of a website or app.
3. To be used as the foundation to further detailed user flow's.

### Steps

1. Reference a recent content inventory or an existing site map.
2. Organize all the pages by the hierarchy of how they're accessible.
3. Subsequent flow charts should be used to document linear flows and other more detailed experiences.
