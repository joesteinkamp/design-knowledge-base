# Design Studio

Designers make their work visible for the whole product organization to have awareness to, collect feedback, generate ideas, and educate others on the design process. All design work should be shown (not just UI work!), including research findings, definition artifacts, etc...

It's an informal and optional time (encourage folks to pop in and out) for the org that is more important for team bonding than it is for feedback (it's a bonus!). Grab a beer or beverage of choice!
