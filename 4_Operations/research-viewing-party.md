# Research Viewing Party

There's no better way to get others to empathize with our users than showing or hearing them. Take some time on a cadence to allow others to see the highlights of the research 

### When to Use

1. Always. Get others to empathize with our users is a constant need.

### Steps

1. Review the UX Research Observation Log for recent golden observations.
2. Look for about 10 to 15 minutes of clips.
3. If not enough golden, request designers to provide there top participants.
4. During the view party, play a single clip at a time and let others discuss.
