# Two Product Designers on a Team

**Note**

Generally, I'm a fan of small cross-functional teams where there is one designer on the team responsible for the design work. It isn't without it's flaws though. For example, a less experienced designer can struggle without the appropriate coaching.

## Potential Models
1. **Master, Apprentice** - a more senior designer leads the work while partnering and coaching the less experienced designer.
2. **UX and UI Role Split** - one designer focuses more on UX end of the spectrum while the other focuses more on the UI.
3. **Agency** - each take a project and own it end to end
4. **Master Agency Hybrid** - each own specific a projects but the other designer is secondary on it. So all work is completed in a pair but decision maker is made clear upfront. *Best used when product designers are of equal experience.*
