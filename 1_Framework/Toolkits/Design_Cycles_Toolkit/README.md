# Design Cycles Toolkit

This is a framework used to define the design process within a fast paced environment. Use as a decision framework for time spent on a project while setting clear expectations of what you hope to achieve with stakeholders. Can be used as a negotiating tactic on what the goals are for design.

## Cycle Rules
1. Focus on one user group per cycle.
2. Tackle one hypothesis per cycle.
3. Hypotheses should be written before cycle kickoff.
4. Clear expectations of user needs and how they currently behave. If there are too many unknowns, then we must spend time doing a discovery cycle.
5. Sprints are intense and have a lot of activities required to be effective. Preserving working time is of the utmost importance.
6. Completely transparent from estimation, expectations, and outputs.
7. Use only for known industries and as an existing continuous in-house design process. *(If you're starting a whole new business, setting up a new design practice, or consulting, this process is not sufficient.)*


## Normal Cycle
- 2 Weeks
- 

### Typical Agenda
1.	[Day 1] Project Kickoff Meeting & Understand 
    1.	Requires: journey maps, empathy maps, jobs to be done, competitive analysis, UX research observation log, design debt backlog, existing IA diagrams
    2.	User Data Report (Observation Log, Journey Maps, Empathy Maps, Design Debt Backlog, etc…)
    3.	Review Analytics
2.	[Day 2] Redefine problem and update definition artifacts
    1.	What we know. What we think we know. What we don’t know. 
    2.	Mind Mapping
    3.	Reframe Problem & Refine Hypotheses
    4.	Prep for divergent design workshop
3.	[Days 3-5] Explore at least 3 divergent concepts
    1.	[1 day] Divergent Design Workshop & Individual Sketching
    2.	[1 day] Document User Flows & Architecture for 3 approaches
    3.	[1 day] Prototypes and Mockups
    4.	Identify design assets needed
    6.	We need a better prototyping process to set us up for validation success
4.	[Day 6] User validation of the concepts
    1.	Concept Evaluation
    2.	Need someone else to do recruitment and scheduling
    3.	Need engineer note taker
5.	[Day 7] Synthesize
    1.	Update Observation Log
6.	[Days 8-10] Decide on direction and refine based on use feedback
    1.	[1 day] Design Critique & Stakeholder Reviews
    2.	[2 days] Refine Deliverables & Discuss with Engineering
    3.	Need component library
    4.	Decide if it’s ready to release with design director


## How to Use Cycles for Projects

### Small Project
- 1 cycle (2 weeks)
- Immediately into detailed design
- Leverage only pre-existing data and research findings

### Medium Project
- 2 cycles (4 weeks)
- 1st cycle - architecture & flow
- 2nd cycle = detailed design

### Large Project 
- 3 cycles (6 weeks)
- 1st cycle - broad conceptual evaluation
- 2nd cycle = architecture & flow
- 3rd cycle = detailed design & refinements 



## Typical Usages

### New Product

### New Feature

### Quick Turnaround

### Post Release: Rethink

### Post Release: Optimization

### Functional Setup (Design Blessing) / Known Solution
- When creating anything is dramatically a better user experience. 
- Limited scope
- Design effort would be best utilized in the future when trying to maximize

### Optimization
- Improve Known Solution
- Optimize the user experience to create better outcomes
- Smaller scope
- 1 Cycle or Mini Cycle

### Maximization
- Dramatically improve known process (existing solution with desire to improve the user experience)
- 2-3 Cycles, potentially with Discovery Cycle

## Other Cycles

### Discovery Cycle
- 1 Week
- Focused on learning and completing research
- Key Output: Hypothesis and Design Cycle plan

### Mini Cycle (Sprint)
- 1 Week

### Extra Mini Cycle
- 1 day
- Facilitate group ideation
