# Design Cycles Toolkit

This is a framework used to define the design process within a fast paced environment. Use as a decision framework for time spent on a project while setting clear expectations of what you hope to achieve with stakeholders. Can be used as a negotiating tactic on what the goals are for design.

## Cycle Rules
1. Focus on one user group per cycle.
2. Tackle one hypothesis per cycle.
3. Hypotheses should be written before sprint kickoff.
4. Clear expectations of user needs and how they currently behave. If there are too many unknowns, then we must spend time doing a discovery cycle.
5. Sprints are intense and have a lot of activities required to be effective. Preserving working time is of the utmost importance.


## Normal Cycle
2 Week 
1.	[THU] Project Kickoff Meeting & Understand 
    1.	Requires: journey maps, empathy maps, jobs to be done, competitive analysis, UX research observation log, design debt backlog, existing IA diagrams
    2.	User Data Report (Observation Log, Journey Maps, Empathy Maps, Design Debt Backlog, etc…)
    3.	Review Analytics
2.	[FRI] Redefine problem and update definition artifacts
    1.	What we know. What we think we know. What we don’t know. 
    2.	Mind Mapping
    3.	Reframe Problem & Refine Hypotheses
    4.	Prep for divergent design workshop
3.	[M-W] Explore at least 3 divergent concepts
    1.	[1 day] Divergent Design Workshop & Individual Sketching
    2.	[1 day] Document User Flows & Architecture for 3 approaches
    3.	[1 day] Prototypes and Mockups
    4.	Identify design assets needed
    5.	Continually post to Gallery.io to show work-in-progress to everyone and print onto walls
    6.	We need a better prototyping process to set us up for validation success
4.	[THU] User validation of the concepts
    1.	Concept Evaluation
    2.	Need someone else to do recruitment and scheduling
    3.	Need engineer note taker
5.	[FRI] Synthesize
    1.	Update Observation Log
6.	[M-W] Decide on direction and refine based on use feedback
    1.	[1 day] Design Critique & Stakeholder Reviews
    2.	[2 days] Refine Deliverables & Discuss with Engineering
    3.	Need component library
7.	[WED] Deliver Evaluation
    1.	Decide if it’s ready to release with design director


## How to Use Cycles for Projects

### Small Project
- 1 cycle (2 weeks)
- Immediately into detailed design

### Medium Project
- 2 cycles (4 weeks)
- 1st cycle - architecture & flow
- 2nd cycle = detailed design

### Large Project 
- 3 cycles (6 weeks)
- 1st cycle - broad conceptual evaluation
- 2nd cycle = architecture & flow
- 3rd cycle = detailed design & refinements 



## Other Cycles

## Discovery Cycle
- 1 Week

### Mini Cycle (Sprint)
- 1 Week

### Extra Mini Cycle
- 1 day
