# Empathy Map

A simple diagram that provides a high level but detailed look at a specific user within a specific context. Often includes: thoughts, feelings, doing, context, pain points, and goals. Also sometimes includes: what they're hearing and saying.

### When to Use

1. To ground the solution requirements around the user and there isn't time for a detailed journey map.
2. To create a basic proto-persona and leverage to reinforce design thinking around a real user.
3. Use as a team exercise to establish all the different assumptions that each have.

### Steps

1. Determine if the empathy map will broadly describe a user type or detail a specific contextual moment around a specific task/goal.
   1. Specific empathy maps are more powerful and practical for product design.
2. Start by describing the general information about the user. Include user type, demographic information, product usage data, etcâ€¦
3. Complete all the remaining sections with how the user behaves to accomplish their goals within their current context.
4. Document that user's goals either broad product goals or specific feature/function goals. Focus on goals not connected to tasks inside the product but jobs in that drive the user to use your product.
