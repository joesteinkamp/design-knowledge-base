## Goals of this Phase
1. Define what the problem is
2. Define when and where does the problem take place (situation)
3. Define who the user is 
4. Define how the user is thinking and feeling (outcomes)
5. Define how the user is doing it
6. Define why the user is thinking and feeling the way they do
7. Define why the user is doing what they're doing (motivation)
8. Define how you're going to approach the solution


## Summarized Activities
1. Synthesize and transfer the findings from Understand by visualizing them  into easily understood documents and artifacts
2. Define what success will look like to the user and business, leverage BIs within this step
3. Rethink how we might solve this problem by reframing the problem for a new perspective


## Questions to Answer
- **What is the customer / user trying to achieve?**
- **How will we know if we've solved the problem?**
- **What is our hypothesis?**
- How does fixing this problem contribute to our strategic goals?
- Who are the users? Are they a subset of our normal user base? If so, can we target them?
- What is the context the user is in when they interact the problem?
- What are attributes that differ between users?
- What is the user’s current situation? Journey?
  - What doing thing is missing?
  - What gets in the user’s way now?
  - What was good? Bad?
- When is it intended to be over?
- What does success look like? How would we describe it? How do we measure it?
  - How we can test & validate possible solutions?
- Is this the biggest problem we're facing?
- What are important experience principles that will guide our design decisions?
