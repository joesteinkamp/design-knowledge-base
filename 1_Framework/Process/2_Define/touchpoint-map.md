# Touchpoint Map
A touchpoint map is a variation on a customer journey, but instead of being user-centric, it focuses more on visualizing all of the touchpoints a user can have with your product or organization. This serves to highlight areas in a service which are under or over-supported and provides a framework to show how and where different departments within your organization need to sync to provide a seamless experience.
