#### Organize Stories \(5 minutes\)

Read stories. [http://www.designkit.org/methods/14](http://www.designkit.org/methods/14)

1. Each team member takes a turn reading all their organize stories they’ve come up with.
2. As they verbally describe their individual problems notes, they place the corresponding sticky on the board.
3. Give each person around 3 minutes to finish so they’re encouraged to be short and sweet.
4. Team members can write down more problem notes if they get inspired by what others are sharing.
5. Wait until the third person has finished presenting before you start grouping the problem notes into categories. \(Tip: Don’t wait until everyone has finished sharing to do this. You’ll have a big, unwieldy task on your hands.\)
6. Don’t worry if it takes a bit for solid categories to form. It’s fine to adjust them as the sharing continues. And, if the first set of categories you make aren’t useful, you can always start over.
7. When everyone is done reading their problem notes, take a picture of all the notes.
