# Design Project Kickoff

Each problem desires its own design approach. A design project kickoff allows the team to get together and discuss how to best handle a project plan.

### When to Use

1. To get alignment around ways to approach the problem and the experience goals
2. Start off project with clear scope

### Steps

1. Review problem space and scope
   1. What is the user's goal?
   2. What are the user's challenges?
2. Define your experience goals and success metrics
   1. What is the designer's intention?
   2. What is the purpose of the design work?
   3. What is the purpose of this experience?
   4. What challenges am I trying to reduce?
3. Discuss
4. Individually write down tasks that should be accomplished for each part of the design process
5. Discuss
6. Determine and outline methods that will be used to accomplish
7. Discuss desire delivery date and ability to meet
8. Document plan and determine if further conversations are necessary to resolve issues

### Kickoff Part 2: User Values, Ideal Experience, Early Sketching

Setup time to work with a collaborator \(or team\) to do early exploration of what's necessary to tackle this problem space. Keep it broad though, this is not the time for settling on an approach \(essentially an abbreviated strategy workshop internally\).

### Tips on Experience Goals & Success Metrics

**Experience Goal** - what is the designer's intention for the experience that will do as defined.

**Success Metric** - what is a measurement\(s\) that would represent a positive outcome of the design work.

##### Broad Experience Goals

* Make \_\_\_\_\_ easier
* Make \_\_\_\_\_ more efficient
* Make \_\_\_\_\_ delightful
* Make \_\_\_\_\_ more useful
* Make \_\_\_\_\_ unnecessary \(eliminate problem\)

##### Potential Success Metric Goals

* Increase conversion
* Decrease dropoff
* Increase happiness
* Increase task success
* Decrease task time
* Decrease number of errors
* Increase confidence
