2. Determine how long you'd like them to track. Consider the variability of the activity - more variability equals more time.
3. Create questions that you'd like your participants to answer every time they log their activity.
4. Give the participants instructions. Ask the participants to reflect on their feelings during the activity.

## Tips
1. If you have in-person contact with participants, provide them with notebooks that they can write in.
