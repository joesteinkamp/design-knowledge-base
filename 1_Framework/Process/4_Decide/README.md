## Goals of Phase
1. Validate which is the best solution for the user
2. Determine the feasibility and viability of our solutions
3. Evaluate the best solution for the business

## Questions to Answer
- **Which solution does the user perform best with?**
- Which solution does the user prefer?
- Does this solve the user's problem?
- What part of the design are we looking for feedback on?
- What are our biggest unknowns and assumptions?
- Are we aligned?
- Does this effectively address the user’s goals and needs?
- Does this meet all functional requirements?
- How could this design fail?
- What assumptions are we making?
- What’s the simpler version of this? Is there anything we can remove?
- What is the user trying to accomplish on this screen?
- Why is that there? Why is that shown at all? Is that worth displaying by default?
- Why is the screen organized this way?
- Why is this a better solution than [established design pattern]?
- Will the user understand what they should do next?
- What UI patterns are you using?
- Does this effectively reflect the brand?
- Are there opportunities to be more consistent?
- How does our solution effectively solve the user’s needs?
- What can we iterate on?
- What will we do in the future? Do we have a clear vision of what this will be in 6 months?
- Are we able to build the solution?
