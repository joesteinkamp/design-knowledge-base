### What, How, Why
1. Going around the room, each person reads their answers aloud and the facilitator writes them on the whiteboard.
2. No argument or discussion yet.
3. Each person looks at the list and quietly writes down their favorite answers.
4. Going around the room, each person reads their votes aloud and the facilitator marks the votes on the whiteboard.
5. Discuss what and how for about five minutes each, but don’t argue the semantics — it’s not that important.
6. At the end of each five-minute segment, the Decider chooses her favorite answer.
7. Discuss why for about ten minutes. This can be difficult, so agree that today’s version will be a placeholder — you can come back to it later.
8. After ten minutes, the Decider makes the call.
9. Take a photo of the whiteboard and add it to your slide deck.


### Brand Values
1. Going around the room, each person reads their values aloud and the facilitator writes them on the whiteboard in one giant list.
2. No argument or discussion yet.
3. Each person looks at the list and quietly writes down the three values they think best describe the company.
4. Going around the room, each person reads their votes aloud and the facilitator marks the votes on the whiteboard.
5. Discuss for about five minutes.
6. At the end of five minutes, the Decider makes the call. Give her a few minutes to quietly write down her top three values, in order. This is the hard part, but it’s also the key to success—you must narrow down to three, and most importantly, you must choose a single most important value.
7. The Facilitator writes the final decision on the whiteboard.
8. Take a photo of the whiteboard and add it to the slide deck.


### Personality Spectrums
1. Draw the spectrums on the whiteboard.
2. Everyone write on a Post-It there name for each range and place it where they believe it lands on the range
3. Discuss any diagram where people disagree about where the company should be. For example, if Andy put a dot right by “Mass Appeal” and Beatrice put a dot right by “Elite”, they should explain their positions. Time this discussion—it needn’t take longer than five to ten minutes.
4. At the end of the discussion, the Decider makes the call. She should be given a few minutes to quietly plot her final choices on the whiteboard.
5. Take a photo of the whiteboard and add it to the slide deck.
