## Goals of Phase
- Generate many divergent solutions to solve the identified problem
- Discover new ways of solving problems
- Position yourself to understand the potential scope of the solution space through experimentation

## Summarized Activities
1. Have a good grasp of the problem space and broadly define solution expectations
2. Collaborate with others to get many perspectives and ideas.
3. Outline different approaches to high-level solution aspects, such as information architecture.

## Questions to Answer
- **What are different ways we could solve this problem?**
- How can we eliminate the user's pain point?
- How can we reduce the user's pain?
- What if…?
- How would it be different if…?
- Suppose that…?
- What if we knew…?
- What would change if…?
- What other way could we…?
- Is someone else already solving this issue? If so, how?
- What is an effective way of solving the user’s needs?
- What are the spectrum ends that the user would find as a acceptable solution?
- What is the ideal experience?
