# High-Fidelity Prototype

A high-fidelity prototype is an interactive representation of the product in its closest resemblance to the final design in terms of details and functionality.** **

From a user testing point of view, a high-fidelity prototype is close enough to a final product to be able to examine usability questions in detail and make strong conclusions about how behavior will relate to use of the final product.

High fidelity prototypes are more time consuming to create but yield more subtlety and nuance. However, high fidelity prototypes should only be created at the final stages of the design process. After divergent ideas have been explored, tested, and iterated upon using paper or low-fidelity prototypes.

### When to Use

1. After core user needs and design assumptions have been validated through low fidelity concept testing
2. When you want to test the details of your products in terms of UI elements, color schemes or copy
3. When you want to test the transitions, animations, and effects of them on the user and user behavior

### Steps

1. Utilize the design system library to build high-fidelity wireframes that align with brand and product guidelines
2. Create hotspots and interactions on high-fidelity wireframes in Flinto, Axure, or other prototyping tool
