# Decision Trees

A basic flowchart to describe how system logic should be approached through visualizing a series of outcomes from a series of decisions.

### When to Use

1. To provide backend system logic to support an intelligent and/or personalized experience.
2. To document the way a user performs a task.

### Steps

1. Identify the goal and the possible outputs you'd like to visualize.
2. Determine the appropriate decisions required to generate all the output states. Often phrased as questions or a conditional statement.
3. Record the decisions the system took to achieve the outputs and diagram this in a “boxes-and-arrows” flow chart.
4. If applicable, identify and record any actions/triggers that would be necessary to initiated the decisions.
