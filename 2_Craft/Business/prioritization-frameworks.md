# Prioritization Frameworks

## Summary of Prioritization Attributes
1. Impact / Magnitude
2. Value
3. Reach / Size of Audience / Scale
4. Confidence
5. Effort / Complexity / Feasibility
6. Risk
7. Cost
8. Level of Customer Satisfaction
   1. Frequency of Complaints
9.  Importance
10. Urgency


## RICE
**Reach**
Estimation of how many people each project will affect within a given period. Measured in number of people/events per time period.
- Use quantitative metrics to determine potential audience

**Impact**
Estimation of the impact on an individual person. Measuring can be subjective, leverage scale as outlined: 3 = "massive impact", 2 = "high", 1 = "medium", 0.5 = "low", .25 = "minimal".
- Leverage user research to estimate impact

**Confidence**
The level of confidence you have about your estimates.  Measuring is subjective, leverage scale as outlined: 100% = "high confidence", 80% = "medium", 50% = "low"
- Use the other 3 measurements to help influence the confidence. The more clearly defined measurements of the other 3 increase the confidence.
	
**Effort**
Estimation of the total amount of time a project will require from all members of your team: product, design, and engineering. Measured in a number of "person-months" - the work that one team member can do in a month. Recommend sticking to whole numbers, unless something takes far less than a month.
- Combine all time estimates for all teams involved and figure out how many months it would take for a single person.

## Opportunity Scoring (JBTD)
Prioritize jobs to be done by mapping out each job to its importance and the current satisfaction based on research.

### Impact Effort Matrix
Sometimes as described as the Value Complexity Matrix.
