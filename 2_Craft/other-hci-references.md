**Occam's Razor**

**Pareto Principle**
Also known as the 80/20 rule.  


**Parkinson's Law**
Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.

**Sturgeon’s Law**
"Ninety percent of everything is crap." Sturgeon’s law tells us the easy way to do things is to make them crappy. It’s very hard to make something good. There’s a decision to be made –which option will you choose. When you take the easy way out, you generally produce crap.
